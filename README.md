About the Project
This project consists of a daily planner for tasks throughout your day.  You are able to add an event in either time slot and save it to the site by clicking on the save button.  It solves the problem of not having an accesible daily planner so you can use this planner to plan your day.  

Usage
Upon starting the site, you can see the date and time at the top of the screen.  You can then enter certain events or tasks in each time slot to plan out your day.  Once you're done, click on the save button to save your event.  Once you refresh your page, your event will still be there until you delete it.  Each time slot also contains a specific color to let you know of the past time, present time, and future time so you can be on top of your tasks.
